# GifTastic
Creates a dynamic webpage that populates with 10 gifs in a certain topic from user choice. This site is very simple. It uses GIPHY API and AJAX promises to generate 10 gifs from either buttons hard coded into the application or, the user can generate their own button and then click on IT to generate 10 gifs of their choice. Once generated, the user simply needs to click on one to animate and click again to end animation.

The purpose of this exercise was to demonstrate my ability to pull information from an API and extract and render information on the viewport for user interaction using Javascript logic.
